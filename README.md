# GoodPress

#### It is well that ~~war~~ Wordless is so ~~terrible~~ intrusive&mdash;otherwise we would grow too fond of it.

Plugin-theme hybrid based on our heavily modified, simplified, [GoodTwinized fork](https://github.com/goodtwin/wordless) of [Wordless](https://github.com/welaika/wordless).

We saw that we always deferred to the Grunt.js method of doing things when possible.


**Download and dump is all you need to do here.**

What we kept:
* Helpers
	* Router
	* Partials
* Initalizers
	* Admin dashboard simplification
	* Custom menus
	* Custom post types

What we didn't:
* Preprocessors (i.e., Rails-like asset pipeline)
	* Ruby dependencies aren't really our bag
	* (read: GRUNT ALL THE THINGS)
* Compilation
	* Did we mention Grunt yet?
* Admin settings/page
